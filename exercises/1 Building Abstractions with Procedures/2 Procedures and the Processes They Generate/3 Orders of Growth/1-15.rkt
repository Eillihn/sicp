;; The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by 
;; making use of the approximation 
;; sin x â‰ˆ x (if x is sufficiently small), 
;; and the trigonometric identity:

;; sin r = 3 sin (r/3) - 4 sin ^ 3 (r/3)

;; to reduce the size of the argument of sin. 
;; (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its 
;; magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.)
;; These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

;; a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?
;; b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) 
;; used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?



;; Answer:

;; a. The procedure p is applied 5 times.
;; (sine 12.15)
;; (p (sine 4.05))
;; (p (p (sine 1.35)))
;; (p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
;; (p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
;; (p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
;; (p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
;; ...

;; b.
;; The angle a is divided by 3 each time the procedure p is applied 
;; or we can say that p is applied once for each complete power of 3 
;; contained within the angle a. 
;; In other words we have O(log(x)) order of growth number of steps
;; and for space? because this is recursice process.
