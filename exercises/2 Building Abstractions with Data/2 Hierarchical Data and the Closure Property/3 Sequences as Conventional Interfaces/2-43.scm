;; Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queens procedure seems
;; to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for 
;; it to solve even the 6Ã—6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out 
;; that he has interchanged the order of the nested mappings in the flatmap, writing it as

;; (flatmap
;;     (lambda (new-row)
;;         (map    (lambda (rest-of-queens)
;;                     (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
;;                 (queen-cols (- k 1))))
;;     (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

;; Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. 
;; Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming 
;; that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T.

;; (flatmap
;;     (lambda (rest-of-queens)
;;         (map (lambda (new-row)
;;                     (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
;;             (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
;;     (queen-cols (- k 1))))))



;; Answer:
;; This interchange makes the program run slowly because recursive call of queen-cols is 
;; evaluated board-size times for each queen-cols call (which is called bord-size times
;; itselves). So, the if the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T,
;; than Louis's program solve it in T^T.
