;; After debugging her program, Alyssa shows it to a potential user, who complains that 
;; her program solves the wrong problem. He wants a program that can deal with numbers 
;; represented as a center value and an additive tolerance; for example, he wants to work 
;; with intervals such as 3.5Â± 0.15 rather than [3.35, 3.65]. Alyssa returns to her desk 
;; and fixes this problem by supplying an alternate constructor and alternate selectors:

;; (define (make-center-width c w)
;;     (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w)))
;; (define (center i)
;;     (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2))
;; (define (width i)
;;     (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))

;; Unfortunately, most of Alyssa's users are engineers. Real engineering situations 
;; usually involve measurements with only a small uncertainty, measured as the ratio of the 
;; width of the interval to the midpoint of the interval. Engineers usually specify 
;; percentage tolerances on the parameters of devices, as in the resistor specifications 
;; given earlier.

;; Define a constructor make-center-percent that takes a center and a percentage
;; tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also define a selector percent 
;; that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval. The center selector is the 
;; same as the one shown above.

(define (make-center-percent c p)
    (let ((w (* c (/ p 100))))
        (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w))))
(define (center i)
    (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2))
(define (width i)
    (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))
(define (percent i)
    (* (/ (width i) (center i)) 100))

(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
(define (upper-bound interval) (max (car interval) (cdr interval))) 
(define (lower-bound interval) (min (car interval) (cdr interval))) 
(define (print-interval p)
    (newline)
    (display "[")
    (display (lower-bound p))
    (display ";")
    (display (upper-bound p))
    (display "]"))



;; Answer:

(define test-interval (make-center-percent 4 25))
(print-interval test-interval)
(percent test-interval)
